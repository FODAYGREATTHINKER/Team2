Team 2 Medical app(android version 4.03)
This is the most recent version where I have made an update in the application.

## WHAT I'VE DONE IN UPDATES.

1. Added Medical details as a new page showing all details of both the medical centres including address and the doctors.
2. Updated Booking Page to add an errocheck that checks if booking is past.
3. Checks now if booking is current or past so user can't make the booking.
4. Added comments to code for quality assurance and people know what the code does.
5. Coudln't finish the map feature as it was too difficult to implement.
